## Data Ingestion

+++

The data was made available thanks to a partnership established by Prof. Giancarlo Manzi of the University of Milan and Clear Channel Italia, the provider of the service. The data is comprised of all the individual trips performed by each client (`cliente_anonimizzato`). This includes the bike type (which can either be a regular bike or an electric bike), the bike identifier, the station of departure and arrival with the time, the duration of the trip `durata_noleggio` plus the total travel distance. We do not know how the total travel distance `distanza_totale` is computed. Here is a selection of fields for the first five rows of the source data (time features are rounded to the daily level to fit into the page):

The data available ranges from the first of June, 2015, to the first of October, 2020, totalling 15.842.891 observations. Data was made available in Excel spreadsheets, following the [Office Open XML SpreadsheetML File Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_standards/ms-xlsx/f780b2d6-8252-4074-9fe3-5d7bc4830968) (the `.xlsx` file format). Python"s Pandas library has methods to read `.xlsx` files; however, given how big these files are, data manipulation would have proven unfeasible.

For this reason, we resorted to some useful and popular open source tools, which we used to build `bash` scripts and functions to automate the conversion from `.xlsx` to `.csv` files, perform some elementary data cleaning and load the data into a local PostgreSQL database. Format conversion to Comma-Separated Values (`.csv`) was performed using [`csvkit`](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit), a Python package to perform basic operations on `.csv` files from the command line. Being written in Python, `csvkit` can be slow. However, as part of a major trend for several command-line applications, `csvkit` was rewritten in Rust, a fast and secure programming language whose popularity has been rising in the last couple of years <cite id="jf5wt">(Perkel, 2020)</cite>. Much alike Julia <cite id="ge16g">(Perkel, 2019)</cite>, Rust is becoming a tool for data science, as well as scientific computing (for example in bio-statistics) as it is "a language that offer[s] the "expressiveness" of Python but the speed of languages such as C and C++" <cite id="1xb31">(Perkel, 2020)</cite>.

The Rust port of `csvkit` is called [`xsv`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv), and is blazing fast. Much like `awk` <cite id="tcloo">(<i>Gawk - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)</i>, n.d.)</cite>, `xsv` can perform filtering operations, but also joins and partitions, as well as computing summary statistics. `xsv` does not offer format conversion (yet), but was used to filter out a negligible number of invalid observations from each original `.xslx` files (after the conversion to `.csv`), and select only the columns that would enter the final dataset.

Finally, `psql` (PostgreSQL"s command line utility) was used to upload the "clean" data into a local database instance. PostgreSQL was also used to perform basic survey statistics, like computing the number of rows, and data aggregation (such as counting the number of observations by year). Looking at the frequency tables by year, there appears to be an oddly small number of observations from 2018. This is because there is indeed missing data from June 2018 until the end of the year. For this reason, we chose to work only with data from June 2015 to the end of May 2018.

## Data Analysis

+++ {"citation-manager": {"citations": {"oz3v4": [{"id": "7765261/VTA4UCWW", "source": "zotero"}]}}, "tags": []}

In addition to selecting only trips from June 2015 to June 2018, we also disregard all rentals whose duration is smaller than one minute (around 4000) - as previously done in the literature <cite id="oz3v4">(Toro et al., 2020)</cite>. This leaves us with more than 11,7 million observations. We will temporarily store these in a [materialised view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-creatematerializedview.html), which we will drop at the end of the data analysis.

The service has almost two hundred thousand unique subscribers in the time period. For the years 2016 and 2017, the only ones for which we have complete data, the number of subscribers is almost a hundred thousand. By looking at the unique subscribers for the other two years, it might seem that the number of subscribers in the second half of the year is higher.

It is also of interest to look at the number of rentals of each user, broken down by year. As expected, there are more observations from the years 2016 and 2017 as these are complete years. The great number of usage translates to an average of almost 4 trips per day - i.e., to reach the first train station and then the workplace.

### Usage Patterns and Origin-Destination Matrix

+++

As a starter, it is useful to look at the origin-destination (OD) matrix, to see which are the most popular starting and departure points. On the aggregate level, the most popular points on the OD matrix are the train stations and sightseeing places such as Duomo.

```{code-cell} ipython3

    def _top_stations(colname: str, _connection, commuting: bool = commuting_hours) -> pd.DataFrame:

            query = f"""
            SELECT
                {colname} AS {colname.replace("nome_", "")},
                COUNT(*) AS numero_noleggi
            FROM bikemi_rentals_before_2019
            WHERE
                EXTRACT("dow" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 0 AND 4 AND
                EXTRACT("hour" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 7 AND 10 OR
                EXTRACT("hour" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 17 AND 20
            GROUP BY
                f{colname}

            FROM bikemi_rentals_before_2019
            GROUP BY
                {colname}
            ORDER BY numero_noleggi DESC
            LIMIT 10;
        """
        return pd.read_sql(query, _connection)

    return pd.concat([_top_stations(col, connection) for col in cols], axis=1)


get_top_stations(["nome_stazione_prelievo", "nome_stazione_restituzione"], conn)
```

The ranking is basically unchanged if we look only at data from Monday to Friday and within "core" commuting hours (say, from 7 to 10 and from 17 to 20). However, trips towards stations become more frequent and destinations such as Moscova are slightly less popular. Indeed, employees might straight bike to Moscova after work to take a sip from their Negroni.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

get_top_stations(["nome_stazione_prelievo", "nome_stazione_restituzione"], conn, commuting_hours=True)
```

The behaviour changes if we look ad the individual trips, i.e. if we `GROUP BY` both departure and destination stations (`nome_stazione_prelievo` and `nome_stazione_restituzione`). To be exact, `Coni Zugna Solari` is close to both the station in Porta Genova as well as the Navigli and Darsena, which partly explains its popularity.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def get_top_od(connection, commuting_hours: bool = False) -> pd.DataFrame:
    if commuting_hours:
        query = """
                SELECT
                    nome_stazione_prelievo AS stazione_prelievo,
                    nome_stazione_restituzione AS stazione_destinazione,
                    COUNT(*) AS numero_noleggi
                FROM bikemi_rentals_before_2019
                WHERE
                    EXTRACT("dow" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 0 AND 4 AND
                    EXTRACT("hour" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 7 AND 10 OR
                    EXTRACT("hour" FROM data_restituzione) BETWEEN 17 AND 20
                GROUP BY
                    nome_stazione_prelievo,
                    nome_stazione_restituzione
                ORDER BY numero_noleggi DESC
                LIMIT 10;

    query = """

    return pd.read_sql(query, connection)

The same considerations apply when looking at the top trips only within the "core" commuting hours. This reinforces the conclusion that BikeMi is consistently used for commuting purposes.

## Spatial Data Analysis

+++ {"citation-manager": {"citations": {"tfga6": [{"id": "7765261/RZW74C9X", "source": "zotero"}]}}, "tags": []}

On its open data portal, the Comune di Milano publishes all sorts of open data - like the daily entrances in the so-called Area C, where access to private cars is limited. On this treasure trove of data, we can also find things like the location of column fountains and newsstands, but also the geo-referenced data of bike tracks and the location of [BikeMi Stations](https://dati.comune.milano.it/it/dataset/ds65_infogeo_aree_sosta_bike_sharing_localizzazione_). As noted previously, the service has some 320 stations, spread unevenly across the town, as it was outlined by previous studies <cite id="tfga6">(Saibene &#38; Manzi, 2015)</cite>. As a starter, we filter out all stations that have been introduced after 2019. This leaves us with 281 official stations, versus 279 in the historic data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

bikemi_stalls = (
    geopandas.read_file(Path(milan_data / "bikemi-stalls.geo.json"))
        .filter(["numero", "nome", "zd_attuale", "anno", "geometry"])
        .rename(columns={
        "numero": "numero_stazione",
        "zd_attuale": "municipio",
        "geometry": "stalls_geometry"
    })
        .set_geometry("stalls_geometry")
        .set_index("numero_stazione")
        .query("anno < 2019")
        .astype({"anno": "int"})
)

bikemi_stalls.head()
```

The data is represented with the (geographic) coordinate reference system (CRS) `EPSG:4326`, but in order to use the `contextily` library we need to cast it to the (projected) reference system `EPSG:3587`. As the map shows, the stalls stretch to the North, towards Bicocca and Sesto San Giovanni. We can already see that the stalls distribution outside the city centre follows bike lanes (in blue).

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

bike_lanes = geopandas.read_file(Path(milan_data / "transports-bike_lanes.geo.json"))

bikes_dict = {"color": "firebrick", "marker": "."}

def plot_stalls_and_bikelanes():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))

    bikemi_stalls.to_crs(3857).plot(ax=ax, **bikes_dict)
    bike_lanes.to_crs(3857).plot(ax=ax)
    cx.add_basemap(ax)

    plt.axis("off")

    plt.title("BikeMi Stalls (Red Dots) and Bike Lanes (Blue)", **title_font)

    plt.show()

plot_stalls_and_bikelanes()
```

### Inspecting Stations with Zero Daily Rentals

+++ {"tags": []}

The stalls in the outer stations are not as used as the ones in the city centre, which come up as an abundance of zeros in the data aggregated at the daily and hourly level. Some of these stations are practically unused. Besides, the great count of stations would represent a problem in the context of multivariate regressions (the so-called $p > n$ problem). Hence, we can drop the unused stations from our data to help us reduce the dimensionality.

We start by creating another two `materialised views` with the daily and hourly rentals, by the station. Since the service is only active between 7 and 24, we just keep hourly observations within that time span. If we simply were to `GROUP BY` station names and time units, we would obtain a series with gaps in the time index. We first create a table with all possible combinations of stations and dates using a `CROSS JOIN` and a common table expression (or `CTE`), then left join on this table the values obtained via the `GROUP BY` on the reference table. A similar query is used to obtain the hourly rentals, with hourly time intervals instead of daily ones.

    """
    
    with connection:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(query_daily_rentals)
            cursor.execute(query_hourly_rentals)

def retrieve_daily_rentals(connection) -> pd.DataFrame:
    query = """
        SELECT * FROM daily_rentals_before_2019;

    return pd.read_sql(query, connection).set_index("data_partenza")

daily_rentals = retrieve_daily_rentals(conn)
```

Then, we compute the number of null values in the data (`null_obs`), pivot the table to wider format, and compute the percentage of missing values in each station (`null_obs`). Using Pandas"`cut()` method, we can convert this numerical column into a categorical variable (`null_obs_ranking`) and choose the number of levels - five, in our case - to split the column into even intervals with.

```{code-cell} ipython3
obs_number = daily_rentals.index.unique().shape[0]

stations_missing_obs = (
    daily_rentals[[col for col in daily_rentals.columns if "numero_stazione" not in col]]
        .pivot(columns="stazione_partenza")
        .replace(0, np.nan)
        .isna().sum()
        .sort_values(ascending=False)
        .pipe(pd.DataFrame)
        # drop the redundant index
        .droplevel(0)
        .rename({0: "null_obs"}, axis=1)
        # create the % by dividing the number of null values by the length of the datetime idnex
        .assign(pct_null=lambda x: x.null_obs / obs_number)
)

# labels for the categorical variable, assumed to be ascending order
labels = ["very_low", "low", "average", "high", "very_high"]

stations_missing_obs["null_obs_ranking"] = pd.cut(
    stations_missing_obs["pct_null"], bins=5, labels=labels
)
```

In this way, we can see that the number of stations with an "unacceptable" number of missing values is smaller than thirty.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

sns.histplot(stations_missing_obs, x="null_obs_ranking")

plt.xlabel("Percentage of null values")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title("Frequency Distribution of Null Values Across Bikemi Stations", **title_font)

sns.despine()

plt.show()
```

More than 80 percent of the stations display a count of null observations inferior to 20 percent.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

sns.ecdfplot(stations_missing_obs, x="pct_null")

plt.xlabel("Percentage of null values")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title("Empirical Cumulative Distribution of Null Values Across BikeMi Stations", **title_font)

sns.despine()

plt.show()
```

We can also join this data with the station spatial data to plot them. While this does not expose patterns that could be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, it shows that some stations need to be omitted even from the most crowded areas in the city. This could not be spotted before as, to the best of our knowledge, no one in the BikeMi literature has ever found a way to take into account how public work on roads and infrastructure had effects on the bike sharing service.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

bikemi_stalls_nulls = (
    bikemi_stalls
        .merge(stations_missing_obs, left_on="nome", right_index=True)
)

def plot_stalls_missing_values() -> None:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))

    (
        bikemi_stalls_nulls
            .to_crs(3857)
            .plot(
                column="null_obs_ranking",
                cmap="coolwarm",
                marker=".",
                legend=True,
                ax=ax
        )
    )

    cx.add_basemap(ax)

    plt.axis("off")

### Area of Analysis

+++ {"citation-manager": {"citations": {"sopwq": [{"id": "7765261/RZW74C9X", "source": "zotero"}], "srqoj": [{"id": "7765261/VTA4UCWW", "source": "zotero"}]}}, "tags": []}

Besides dropping the "emptiest" stations, we should also come up with a way to narrow down the geographic area inside which we perform the analysis. Previously, authors have chosen to analyse just the area inside the Bastioni, or "Area C" <cite id="sopwq">(Saibene &#38; Manzi, 2015)</cite> or the whole set of stations <cite id="srqoj">(Toro et al., 2020)</cite>. This was mainly due to the different purposes of their analysis and the data availability (Saibene and Manzi analyse data from 2008 to 2012). For our goal, as well as the policymaker perspective, this choice seems restricting, as it leaves out most of the train stations. It is worth noting that analysing the bike sharing traffic inside of Area C can be appropriate: for example, since, the municipality publishes the number of daily accesses to the area, which could be used to evaluate the effect of sharing services on traffic.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

area_c = (
    geopandas
        .read_file(Path(milan_data / "administrative-area_c.geo.json"))
        .filter(["tipo", "geometry"])
        .query("tipo == 'AREA_C'")
)

def plot_area_c() -> None:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))

    area_c.to_crs(3857).plot(ax=ax, cmap="Pastel1", alpha=0.6)
    bikemi_stalls.to_crs(3857).plot(ax=ax, **bikes_dict)
    cx.add_basemap(ax)

    plt.axis("off")

    plt.title("BikeMi Stalls (dots) and Area C (red)", **title_font)

    plt.show()

plot_area_c()

The area we propose is the road ring across Milan, informally referred to as Circonvallazione. This area encapsulates the city centre, as well as most of the train stations, and is represented by the green shade in the map below. This is arguably limiting, as the area does not take in Lambrate and Villapizzone/Bovisa train stations. However, one might argue that it is unlikely for individuals to choose to go to Lambrate and then rent a bike to get to the city centre, as they can just get to Centrale; the same goes for the other stations. In other words, this area contains a sufficient amount of stations to provide a useful forecast for the policymaker, albeit neglecting the outer stalls.

This approach might just reinforce the bias towards the centre of the city, but given the technical constraints seems to be the more viable option. However, as a comparison, Area C would only contain one train station, whereas this area contains all of the top rental stalls from the origin-destination (OD) matrix.
