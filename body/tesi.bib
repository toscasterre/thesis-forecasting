  abstract = {Visual analytics for time series data has received a considerable amount of attention. Different approaches have been developed to understand the characteristics of the data and obtain meaningful statistics in order to explore the underlying processes, identify and estimate trends, make decisions and predict the future. The machine learning and visualization areas share a focus on extracting information from data. In this paper, we consider not only automatic methods but also interactive exploration. The ability to embed efficient machine learning techniques (clustering and classification) in interactive visualization systems is highly desirable in order to gain the most from both humans and computers. We present a literature review of some of the most important publications in the field and classify over 60 published papers from six different perspectives. This review intends to clarify the major concepts with which clustering or classification algorithms are used in visual analytics for time series data and provide a valuable guide for both new researchers and experts in the emerging field of integrating machine learning techniques into visual analytics.},

Overall, we find that weather impacts cycling rates more than topography, infrastructure, land use mix, calendar events, and peaks. The policy implication is that, in northern latitudes which experience inclement weather for extended periods, creating state-of-the-art cycling infrastructure - sheltered, promptly cleared from snow, and potentially heated - may be much more important than in warm and sunny places if planners are to succeed in ``getting people out of their cars.''},

The consequences of pollution are increasingly evident, and transport, being one of the main sources of congestion and pollution, is cited as the major culprit. In this context and as one of the few positive externalities of the COVID-19 pandemic, micro-mobility and, more generally, environmentally friendly and co-managed mobility, are gaining ground. In particular, bike-sharing has seen double-digit growth rates of diffusion and use in its various forms. It is a fast and efficient solution, with zero emissions, convenience, speed of movement for short distances and beneficial effects on users' health. However, its use is still rather limited in Italian cities. Through an online survey conducted at the national level in 2020, we shed light on the elements that determine the adoption of bike-sharing among potential users. Through factor analysis, ordered logit and probit regressions, we have identified the factors that facilitate the extensive adoption of this service. In addition, we have seen how consumers' habits have changed, comparing them in the pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown periods and highlighting the health benefits for both potential and current users. The results and policy implications could be useful for local regulators and bike-sharing scheme operators.},

We propose a new comprehensive dynamic bike redistribution methodology that starts from the prediction of the number and position of bikes over a system operating area and ends with a relocation Decision Support System. The relocation process is activated at constant gap times in order to carry out dynamic bike redistribution, mainly aimed at achieving a high degree of user satisfaction and keeping the vehicle repositioning costs as low as possible. An application to a test case study, together with a detailed sensitivity analysis, shows the effectiveness of the suggested novel methodology for the real-time management of the free-floating bike-sharing systems.},

It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek etal. (1951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method or Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).}

Trips with their origins, destinations, and travel times are now collected in publicly available databases, allowing for detailed demand forecasting with methods exploiting big and accurate data. In this paper, we predict the demand pattern of New York City bikes with a low-dimensional approach utilizing three-level data clustering. We use historical demand data along with temperature and precipitation to first aggregate and then decompose data to obtain meaningful clusters. The core of this approach lies in the proposed clustering technique, which reduces the dimension of the problem and, differently from other machine learning techniques, requires limited assumptions on the model or its parameters. The proposed method allows, for the given temperature and precipitation method, to obtain expected vector of movement (mean number and direction of trips) for each zone. In this paper, we synthesize more than 17 million trips into daily and zonal vectors of movement, which combined with weather data allow forecasting of the trip demand. The method allows us to predict the demand with over 75\% accuracy, as shown in series of experiments in which various settings and parameterizations are validated against 25\% holdout data.},

  abstract = {Bike sharing is booming globally as a green transportation mode, but the occurrence of over-demand stations that have no bikes or docks available greatly affects user experiences. Directly predicting individual over-demand stations to carry out preventive measures is difficult, since the bike usage pattern of a station is highly dynamic and context dependent. In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic cluster-based framework for over-demand prediction. Depending on the context, we construct a weighted correlation network to model the relationship among bike stations, and dynamically group neighboring stations with similar bike usage patterns into clusters. We then adopt Monte Carlo simulation to predict the over-demand probability of each cluster. Evaluation results using real-world data from New York City and Washington, D.C. show that our framework accurately predicts over-demand clusters and outperforms the baseline methods significantly.},

Through the use of both global and local autocorrelation measures, the autocorrelation structure of the road network is found to be dynamic and heterogeneous in both space and time.

They are not less motorized than the general population and use ES occasionally. Their main motivation is travel time savings followed by playfulness and money savings. However, users seeking money savings are not frequent riders. They shifted mainly from walking and public transportation (72\%) and few have increased their total mobility by making new trips (6\%). Findings can be useful to researchers, policy makers, and FFES operators especially in the context of COVID pandemics.},

In contrast to conventional goods and services, digital goods and services are more easily scalable but require more upfront intangible investment. These features require consideration of fixed costs and a departure from perfect competition and raise issues about market entry. Another important dimension is the skill demand of both sectors, with the latter requiring a larger share of workers with digital skills. Since COVID-19 is expected to induce a persistent increase of demand for digital services, we use this model to estimate the likely economic impacts. We are in particular interested how the digital transition is affecting the labour market and the functional distribution of income. The paper shows how the distribution of economic rents between workers with digital skills and platforms is determined by labour supply conditions and entry barriers. This suggests that there is a role for competition policy and labour market policies to support the digital transition.},

This article evaluates recent studies on station-based bike sharing in literature and seeks answers to two main research questions: First, how do the weather conditions, built environment and land use, public transportation, socio-demographic attributes, temporal factors, and safety affect the bike-sharing trip demand? Second, what are the most commonly used factors in literature affecting trip demand? For this purpose, an overview of the factors affecting trip demands has been established to evaluate the performance of Bike-Share Programs(BSPs) comprehensively. The results can provide reliable estimate for planners or decision-makers in understanding the key factors contributing to bike-sharing demand. The information obtained from this overview can also be a guideline for BSP planners, policymakers and researchers to improve the efficiency of BSPs.},

  abstract = {Covid19-induced lockdown measures caused modifications in atmospheric pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Urban road traffic was the most impacted, with 48\textendash 60\% average reduction in Italy. This offered an unprecedented opportunity to assess how a prolonged ({$\sim$}2 months) and remarkable abatement of traffic emissions impacted on urban air quality. Six out of the eight most populated cities in Italy with different climatic conditions were analysed: Milan, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples, and Palermo. The selected scenario (24/02/2020\textendash 30/04/2020) was compared to a meteorologically comparable scenario in 2019 (25/02/2019\textendash 02/05/2019). NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 observations from 58 air quality and meteorological stations were used, while traffic mobility was derived from municipality-scale big data. NO2 levels remarkably dropped over all urban areas (from~-24.9\% in Milan to~-59.1\% in Naples), to an extent roughly proportional but lower than traffic reduction. Conversely, O3 concentrations remained unchanged or even increased (up to 13.7\% in Palermo and 14.7\% in Rome), likely because of the reduced O3 titration triggered by lower NO emissions from vehicles, and lower NOx emissions over typical VOCs-limited environments such as urban areas, not compensated by comparable VOCs emissions reductions. PM10 exhibited reductions up to 31.5\% (Palermo) and increases up to 7.3\% (Naples), while PM2.5 showed reductions of {$\sim$}13\textendash 17\% counterbalanced by increases up to {$\sim$}9\%. Higher household heating usage (+16\textendash 19\% in March), also driven by colder weather conditions than 2019 (-0.2 to~-0.8~\textdegree C) may partly explain primary PM emissions increase, while an increase in agriculture activities may account for the NH3 emissions increase leading to secondary aerosol formation. This study confirmed the complex nature of atmospheric pollution even when a major emission source is clearly isolated and controlled, and the need for consistent decarbonisation efforts across all emission sectors to really improve air quality and public health.},

Previous research has investigated mode choice, travel destination, and other travel choices for 1 day only. However, it cannot be assumed that travel choices do not vary from day to day and that most individuals travel by the same transportation mode every day. Day-to-day decisions to cycle are affected by work characteristics, commute journey characteristics, and weather conditions. More specifically, workers wearing business attire, needing to transport goods, needing a car during office hours, having longer commute distances, commuting in the dark, and facing a higher wind speed or a more or longer duration of rain are less likely to commute by bicycle. Positive effects were found for temperature and the duration of sunshine. The results show that factors that can differ on a daily basis largely influence bicycle mode choice from day to day. The results show that two groups of part-time cyclists exist: occasional cyclists and frequent cyclists. Whereas the decisions of occasional cyclists to commute by bicycle are more affected by positive weather conditions, frequent cyclists are discouraged from cycling by more practical barriers, including wind speed and the need to be at multiple locations.},

However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. In this paper we present two algorithms which extend the k-means algorithm to categorical domains and domains with mixed numeric and categorical values. The k-modes algorithm uses a simple matching dissimilarity measure to deal with categorical objects, replaces the means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. With these extensions the k-modes algorithm enables the clustering of categorical data in a fashion similar to k-means. The k-prototypes algorithm, through the definition of a combined dissimilarity measure, further integrates the k-means and k-modes algorithms to allow for clustering objects described by mixed numeric and categorical attributes. We use the well known soybean disease and credit approval data sets to demonstrate the clustering performance of the two algorithms. Our experiments on two real world data sets with half a million objects each show that the two algorithms are efficient when clustering large data sets, which is critical to data mining applications.},

  abstract = {The UK implemented a lockdown in Spring (2020) to curtail the person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Measures restricted movements to one outing per day for exercise and shopping, otherwise most people were restricted to their dwelling except for key workers (e.g. medical, supermarkets, and transport). In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30/03/2020 to 03/05/2020 (weeks 14\textendash 18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO2, O3 and PM2.5 from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017\textendash 19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69\% reduction in traffic overall (74\% reduction in light and 35\% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO2 of 38.3\% (-8.8~{$\mu$}g/m3) and PM2.5 of 16.5\% (-2.2~{$\mu$}g/m3). Improvements in NO2 and PM2.5 were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O3 concentrations on average increased by 7.6\% (+4.8~{$\mu$}g/m3) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O3 at urban background locations. BAU models predicted comparable NO2 reductions and O3 gains, although PM2.5 episodes would have been more prominent without lockdown. Results demonstrate the relatively modest contribution of traffic to air quality, suggesting that sustained improvements in air quality require actions across various sectors, including working with international and European initiatives on long-range transport air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and O3.},

  abstract = {A series of strict lockdown measures were implemented in the areas of China worst affected by coronavirus disease 19, including Wuhan, to prevent the disease spreading. The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9\% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5\% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015 to 2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 36.9\% and remained the main pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) showed the largest decrease of approximately 53.3\%, and ozone (O3) increased by 116.6\%. The proportions of fixed-source emissions and transported external-source emissions in this area increased. After the lockdown, O3 pollution was highly negatively correlated with the NO2 concentration, and the radiation increase caused by the PM2.5 reduction was not the main reason for the increase in O3. This indicates that the generation of secondary pollutants is influenced by multiple factors and is not only governed by emission reduction.},

Both dockless bike sharing (DBS) and taxis are important feeder modes for metros, which provide on-demand travel options with high flexibility and accessibility. Based on one-week trip data of DBS and taxis during a concurrent period in Beijing, China, the paper aims to compare the temporal-spatial distribution of two modes as first-and-last-mile connectors and find out the socio-demographic and built-environment factors that impact their usage. K-means clustering is implemented to visualize the spatial distribution of DBS and taxis around metro stations, and the spatial lag model incorporating spatial autocorrelations of variables is developed. The results show that people prefer to use DBS as a substitutable mode for bus services to serve first-mile interchange in the morning. Also, less economically developed areas with a high density of branches and fewer signalized intersections are more favored by DBS users, whereas people in the central areas with high housing price and developed arterial road network tend to take a taxi, especially during evening peak period. The study can offer the policy guidance to improve DBS services, and several recommendations are suggested to ensure the sustainable development of DBS.},

However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

In this paper we focus on the successful example of Milan's BikeMi PSBS which is giving very positive results in terms of satisfaction for all the actors involved, i.e. the service management, city council and users. From the available data it can be inferred that the bicycle overcome the car central areas in terms of speed, distance travelled daily, and choice of multiple itineraries, especially during peak periods and in proximity of the main railway stations. The main bicycle tracks and hotspots are also detected revealing an imbalance between the northern and the southern part of the city, with the northern part better covered by the service.},

  abstract = {In 2014, Seattle implemented its own bike-sharing system, Pronto. However, the system ultimately ceased operation three years later on March 17th, 2017. To learn from this failure, this paper seeks to understand factors that encourage, or discourage, bike-sharing trip generation and attraction at the station level. This paper investigates the effects of land use, roadway design, elevation, bus trips, weather, and temporal factors on three-hour long bike pickups and returns at each docking station. To address temporal autocorrelations and the nonlinear seasonality, the paper implements a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) that incorporates the joint effects of a time metric and time-varying variables. The paper estimates models on total counts of pickups and returns, as well as pickups categorized by user types and by location. The results clarify that effects of hilly terrain and the rainy weather, two commonly perceived contributors to the failure. Additionally, results suggest that users in the University District, presumably mostly university students, tend to use shared bikes in neighborhoods with a higher household density and a higher percentage of residential land use, and make bike-sharing trips regardless workdays or non-workdays. The paper also contributes to the discussion on the relationship between public transportation service and bike-sharing. In general, users tend to use bike-sharing more at stations that have more scheduled bus trips nearby. However, some bike-sharing users may shift to bus services during peak hours and rainy weather. Several strategies are proposed accordingly to increase bike ridership in the future.},

  abstract = {In the pursuit of sustainable mobility policy makers are giving more attention to cycling. The potential of cycling is shown in countries like the Netherlands, where cycling covers 25~\% of all person trips. However, the effect of policy interventions on cycling demand is difficult to measure, not least caused by difficulties to control for changing context variables like weather conditions. According to several authors weather has a strong influence on cycling demand, but quantitative studies about the relationship are scarce. We therefore further explored this relationship, with the aim of contributing to the development of a generic demand model with which trend and coincidence in bicycle flows might be unraveled. The study is based on time-series between 1987 and 2003 of daily bicycle flows, collected on 16 cycle paths near two cities in the Netherlands. The regression analyses show that, not surprisingly, recreational demand is much more sensitive to weather than utilitarian demand. Most daily fluctuations (80~\%) are described by weather conditions, and no less than 70~\% of the remaining variation is locally constrained. The regression can therefore mainly be improved by incorporating path specific, as yet unknown, variables. We used the regression results to calculate weather-inclusive bicycle flow predictions and found indications of a downward trend in recreational demand. This trend has been off-set in the observed flows by more favorable weather conditions over the years considered.},

Instead of striving for a new definition, the authors distinguish nine types of sharing practices and provide an overview of prior investigations on sharing practices across three levels of analysis and 15 research areas. The structured analysis is translated into opportunities for future research on the Sharing Economy. Design/methodology/approach The study follows a structured literature review approach to uncover practices related to the Sharing Economy and similar phenomena. The authors analyze 210 articles from a broad number of disciplines, and develop a categorizing framework for Sharing Economy practices. Findings The paper identifies nine different types of sharing practices and provides a structured way for analyzing, comparing and positioning research on the Sharing Economy and related phenomena. Research limitations/implications The categorization of sharing practices and the embedded interdisciplinary overview of studies on the Sharing Economy help to explain potentially contradictory research results and uncovers opportunities for future research in the topic area. Originality/value Given the variety of disciplines dealing with the Sharing Economy and the plenitude of definitions and related concepts, the categorization and research overview provides a consolidated view of the knowledge in the topic area and an effective tool for identifying paths for future research.},

An approximate optimal allocation model is proposed to maximise the recourses. Numerical examples are tested in a simplified Sioux Falls network and a real bike sharing network in Singapore to illustrate the effectiveness and practicability. Results show that the proposed method could identify the reasonable and efficient allocation position quickly. Market follower should apply the same allocation strategy as market leader, while use lower ticket, more bikes, and large batches allocation to strive for market share.},

In normal situation, users pay a positive price to operators for using a bike. However, when imbalanced distribution of bikes occurs in the system, users who cycle from the oversupplied area to undersupplied area will receive monetary reward from the operator, i.e., negative pricing applies. A user equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment model is developed to capture travellers' mode-path choice behaviour in response to the proposed dynamic pricing strategy. Travellers can either use a single transportation mode (e.g. walking, cycling and bus) or take multiple modes to complete their trips. The user equilibrium travel pattern is formulated as a variational inequality problem and then solved by a path-flow swapping algorithm. Two numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed dynamic pricing strategy with negative prices is effective in terms of attracting users as well as achieving a more balanced bike repositioning, especially when the number of bikes provided in the system is limited.},
